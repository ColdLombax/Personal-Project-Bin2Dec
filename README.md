# Project Details
This is a small little website that uses react to convert binary into decimal and visaversa.

Check out the [DEMO](http://coldlombax.github.io/bin2dec-project)

## Motivation
I have been struggling to make a complete project, this was my goal, to start small and continue my development.

This is my first COMPLETE project I have done on github, I usually struggle to complete my projects due to my pride and wanting to always achieve better results; I finally managed to complete and deploy a project! (**IT FEELS GREAT!**).

## Tools
- Built using, [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- Built using, [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/). 
- Deployment using, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


### Future Goals?

* I'd love to add more base conversions.
* Redesign the mobile version. (There's an issue with typing).
